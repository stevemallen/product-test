/**
 * Simple checkout application, implementing a shopping cart.
 * There are two kinds of products: Apples and Oranges, with different prices
 * The Checkout service takes a list of items and calculates the total cost
 * Apples are 60p each and Oranges are 25p each
 * 
 * Example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05
 *
 * We use JSR-354 to represent monetary values (rather than floats or doubles which have
 * problems with precision).  Better to re-use a library, than roll our own.
